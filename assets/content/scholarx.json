Also there is no proper mechanisms for Sri Lankan students to connect with Sri Lankans who are living abroad.</br>\n\n                        Reason 2 — There is no proper platform for Sri Lankans who lives abroad to share their knowledge with the Sri Lankan students.</br></br>\n\n                        In order to address these two problems we started the program.",
